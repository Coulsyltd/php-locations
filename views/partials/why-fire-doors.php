            <p>Buildings are compartmented to delay the spread of fire from one area to another. The compartments are usually linked by doors to allow for passage of traffic around the building.</p>
            <p>Doorsets have two important functions in a fire, when closed they form a barrier to fire spread and when open they provide a means of escape.</p>
            <p>All of our fire doors are tested and proven to the appropriate regulations, to provide you with absolute assurance that our doors are fit for purpose and gurantee your building's safety.</p>
